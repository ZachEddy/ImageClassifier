<h1>BacteriaNet</h1>
A neural network implemented in Python to classify images of bacteria and other microorganisms 

<p>
I'm building a convolutional neural network to identify images of single-celled organisms. To get things rolling, I've started by using the CIFAR-10 dataset. This contains five batches of 10,000 32x32 pixel images. Each of the 10 training categories (cars, frogs, boats, etc.) have 1,000 images each.
<br>
<br>
Once I get it working, I'd like to mount it on a Django app that lets users feed images through the ConvNet themselves. I don't have any attachment specifically to Django, but it'll keep everything homogenously in Python.


We'll see how it goes!

I'm making a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to classify images. I chose this project for my Capstone class because I've wanted to build one for a while. To get things rolling, I'm using the CIFAR-10. This is a dataset that contains five data batches, each with 10,000 images (1,000 images for each of the 10 possible training categories). 

I hope to use the neural network for identifying single-celled organisms like bacteria. In the long run, I want to build a Django app that will let users feed images of microorganisms to the neural net, and the neural net will inform the user of what they're looking at. We'll see how it goes!
